# Superficial-Intelligence
Don't pay attention to this name, I just can't think of something better.

This project is highly inspired by a tutorial from CodeBullet (which I highy recommend): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOZfhUcNiqk&t=4s, on this video he explains a generic algorithm for "simulating natural selection".

All here is done for killing time so... yeah, you can look at code but you would be sad.
